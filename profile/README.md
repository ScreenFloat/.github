## 🧠 About ScreenFloat for Mac

ScreenFloat is a screenshot and screen-capture powerhouse built to change how you interact with captures on macOS. Instead of just saving screenshots to a folder, ScreenFloat lets you invoke captures, recordings, or timed shots and immediately see them floating above all your apps. Whether you're trying to reference a diagram while writing, copy data from one window to another, or verify UI elements without shuffling windows, ScreenFloat keeps your captures visible, interactive, and available.

These floating shots aren’t static. You can resize them, annotate (draw, highlight, redact), trim recordings, extract text via OCR, detect data like links, QR codes, addresses, and even apply workflows via double-click actions. Each shot is also stored in a rich “Shots Browser” library where you can tag, favorite, rate, search (including via Spotlight), organize into folders (including Smart Folders), sync via iCloud, and export to share or use elsewhere.  

It also includes advanced editing options: crop, rotate, fold, “de-retinize”, overlay effects, color pickers, redaction, and annotation tools that don’t damage the original image. ScreenFloat supports live workflows: capture via keyboard shortcuts, widget, or menu bar; record audio & video; pause & resume recordings; create exportable GIFs or movies; share via drag-and-drop, iCloud link, or other services.  

Performance and usability are top notch: optimized for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, floating shots do not block your workflow; you can set them to ignore clicks or remain pinned in certain Spaces. The UI is clean, modern, and stays out of your way until needed. For anyone who works with many screenshots, presentations, design reference, documentation, or just values visual reminders on screen, ScreenFloat transforms the way you capture, reference, edit, and organize visuals on Mac.
